## Description

_One day, I would like to produce a more intuitive, responsive page that is clean of blocks, borders, and any sort of "obvious" components. I structured the layout as a resume but, ideally, with more time would like to create a more interactive webspace._

* _Open Git Bash or Terminal and type "~/desktop"
* _After type "git clone https://github.com/marcusanthonylorenzo/portfolio-landing-page_
