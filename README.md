# _Personal Landing Page_

#### By _**Marcus Padilla**_

#### _First project, an online "resume" of sorts. Never used CSS Grid before, used documentation to learn and apply by a 5pm deadline._

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Git

## Description

_I structured the layout as a resume but, ideally with more time, would like to create a more interactive webspace. Also, no theme was used i.e. Figma, Photoshop, Shopify. One day, I would like to produce a more intuitive, responsive page that is clean of blocks, borders, and any sort of "obvious" components._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download and install Git Bash (Windows) or open Terminal(Mac).
* Open Git Bash or Terminal and type "~/desktop" (type all commands without quotes, this is just to clarify the command strings!).
* This will bring you to your desktop location on the command line, to receive files.
* Next, type "git clone https://github.com/marcusanthonylorenzo/portfolio-landing-page".
* Once completed, type "Code ." or open in any text editor. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Once your text editor is open, access "index.html" via live server or manually with your browser.

## Known Bugs

* No media queries, responsiveness ideal for maximized desktop browser window at 1200x700 or larger.
